# Cloud Kingdom RPG
 A massive text-based RPG that I developed in Java! 

# Save System
The game will autosave your progress as you go, but you can also make manual saves at any point you like. These save files will be stored as text files and will not reset upon restarting the program. As long as you don't delete your files, your saves will always be there!

# Map (Spoiler Warning!)
If you're having trouble completing the game, here is a map of the entire game board.
